# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds machine learning models to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical features from the `kidney_disease.csv` dataset.

## Objective
To develop and compare ML models that can accurately classify CKD vs non-CKD patients.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP, Jupyter
